        <h1> Biography </h1>
        <p> My name is Kareema Wilson. I was born in Queens, NY but was raised in Laurelton, NY. Now, I reside in
            Newnan, GA. I am the oldest of three and I have a pet dog named Tango. My favorite season is summer and
            favorite color is purple.
        </p>
        <p> I would love to work in industry for at least 2 years and then go to
            graduate school to earn a master's or doctoral degree in either Human-Computing Interaction or Cyber
            Security. I do not know where I might be going for graduate school but I do know that I want to earn
            another degree after graduating from Spelman. I am interest in working in Information Technology area.

        <h1> Computer Science </h1>
        <p> Computer Science is my major and this was chosen since I was a kid. As a
            computer science major, I have learned some many languages over the years and a deeper
            understanding of computation theories since day one of freshmen year.
            The CS department has helped me develop skills like every before and obtain the knowledge that will
            take me in the industry and more schooling. I have gained an internship with a non-profit government
            corporation which allowed me to love working with Phones System and Networking team.
            My professors are renowned authors, reasearchers, and professors with amazing crendtials. Overall, I
            love being a computer science major and I would not change it for the world.
